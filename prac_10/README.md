# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
At the beginning of the semester, my time estimates are generally inaccurate. I often underestimate the time required to complete tasks, especially when dealing with more complex projects or new concepts that I am encountering for the first time.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
As I gradually became familiar with Python syntax and task structure, my estimates became more accurate. I started to learn how to break tasks down into smaller parts and allocate time more reasonably based on the difficulty of each part.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I have learned that making accurate estimates requires the accumulation of experience and an honest assessment of one's abilities and progress. Regularly reviewing and recording the actual time taken is very helpful for improving estimates in the future.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
I have learned many practical programming habits, such as how to name variables more clearly, when to appropriately use function separation, and how to use Python's built-in functions more effectively. This feedback has improved the readability and efficiency of my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?
By reading and analyzing others' code, I discovered various approaches to problem-solving and noticed some common mistakes that I tend to overlook, such as not handling input validation or edge cases. I also learned how to provide feedback in a constructive manner.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1
complete all by ZhihaoTang615 ， Pull Request #3 ， ZhihaoTang615/cp1404practical

### Explanation
I pointed out the issue of unclear variable naming and suggested using more descriptive names, such as changing `x` to `number_of_items`. This improved the readability of the code and helped developers understand the code's intent faster.

### Good Code Review 2
Prac 05 feedback by saikokokyaw ， Pull Request #1 ， saikokokyaw/CP1404practicals

### Explanation
I found that the function did not handle errors and suggested adding a try-except block to handle file read and write errors. This suggestion enhanced the robustness of the code, making it more reliable in real-world scenarios.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I will add a section called 'Code Optimization Challenge' to each practical task, encouraging students not only to implement functionality but also to try to refactor and optimize existing code. Additionally, I will include a 'Reflection Notes' segment to cultivate students' self-assessment skills.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
I do quite well in following the code style guidelines (PEP8) and writing clear comments. I am also good at learning from mistakes and can actively reflect on and adjust my coding methods after each submission.
