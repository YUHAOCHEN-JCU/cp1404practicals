# Practical 06
I feel that the course content is becoming increasingly difficult. Previously, I could complete assignments completely by myself, but now I need to constantly communicate with classmates, search for information online, and watch videos to complete assignments. Perhaps the amount of practice is not enough, so I should practice more. I should remember the courseware at home because some of the content on the courseware is not included in the assignment, but it is equally important. I don't use variables well when writing code. Now I study Python for more than 2 hours every day, but I still need to work harder and be more serious
