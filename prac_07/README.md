# Practical 07

## About This Project

This repository contains my practical work for the subject CP1404 Programming II at James Cook University. It includes weekly practical exercises, assignments, and examples that demonstrate key programming concepts in Python.

My name is Yu Haochen, and I am a student at JCU studying Computer Science. This repository shows my progress and understanding of Python and clean coding principles throughout the semester.

## Clean Code Lessons Learned

Meaningful Names: Use descriptive and unambiguous variable and function names that reflect their purpose.
Small Functions: Break down large tasks into smaller, reusable, and testable functions.
Consistent Formatting: Maintain consistent indentation, spacing, and line length for readability, using tools like “Reformat Code” in PyCharm.
